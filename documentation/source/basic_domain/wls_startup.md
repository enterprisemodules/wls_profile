This class is the default implementation for making sure WebLogic gets started after a system reboot.

Using hiera, you can customize some of the aspects of this process.

When these customizations aren't enough, you can replace the class with your own class. See [wls_profile::weblogic](./weblogic.html) for an explanation on how to do this.
